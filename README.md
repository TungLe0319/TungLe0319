###  Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is  Tung Le and I currently just finished my course at Boise Codeworks. My passions are in design and front-end development while still having interest in back-end deployment.I love the entire process of coding the critical thinking and problem-solving and those triumphant Yesses! after solving a problem that i was currently facing, the never-ending learning that constantly keeps you engages and excited to never see the end to that road. the relaxion of putting on a pod-cast or lofi while beeing steeped into your mind while coding. I have a long standing background in team based environments and customer service that has given me the ability to easily navigate social and team environments, I enjoy working with others and finding flexible and new solutions to problems.
